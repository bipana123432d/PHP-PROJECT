        <p>Founded in 2016, Deerwalk Sifal School is determined to help our students grow as a good global citizen with solid academic skill in language, math, and science. We make sure we get the best out of every student and help each find their strength. We focus on the following areas at every level.

<br>
            Sifal School (also known as Deerwalk Sifal School - DSS) is a grade 1 to 12 Secondary Science School where our graduates after (+2 Science) go to the ranges of Universities in Abroad and Nepal. More than 60% of our graduates are pursuing Science, Technology and Engineering courses and are equally doing excellent in the Medical Science. Despite these, our graduates also choose to go into the Liberal Arts, Law, Management colleges and many more.
<br>
            At DSS, the students maintain the world class standard in Mathematics and Science focusing on their holistic development with our well defined 𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗣𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.

            <li>ECA 𝑆𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠</li>
           <li>𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑆𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠 (𝑅𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 - 𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 - 𝐶𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔)</li>
            <li>𝐴𝑐𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑐 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑠</li>
        </ul>
        We believe every student should learn basic science during their first twelve years of education and then later choose other faculties in the colleges if a student wishes to. Hence, science is compulsory for every student at Deerwalk Sifal School.
